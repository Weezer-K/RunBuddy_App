Before using our repository, make sure to send us your SHA1 key. We will then update our google.json file with your key so that you can run our app on your device.

## Important Notices:
* Make sure to have the run configuration set to run "app" instead of "app.libs" or anything else.
* We calculate location difference and measure that as a distance difference, therefore don't run back and forth, instead you should run to make sure your locations are changing meaningfully.
* If you choose to use a Mock GPS instead of really running to test it, follow the guidance below in "Mock GPS"

## Mock GPS:
* Step 1: Download The Mock Locations app off the google play store, Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.gavrikov.mocklocations
* Step 2: Set ‘Select mock location app’ as your gps mock app in developer settings
* Step 3: In the map, long click on the map to mark a “starting position” and a “ending position” and then click ✅ to continue. Then it will ask for some metrics like how fast you want to run etc. After setting up the details, click “go!” and then the fake run will start. 

## To run the App:
* Step 1: Login with a valid Gmail Account. Select "Sign in without Fitbit" if you don't have one or don't want to use ours.
* Step 2: Sign in with your own fitbit account or the one provided below (if chose to "Sign in with Fitbit"):
   
    Username: pmenexas13@gmail.com
    
    Password: 8NS#?v%vTUPkPfs
    
* Step 3: When prompted by fitbit, select allow all permissions
* Step 4: You are all set to go; Follow the final report pdf which serves as a manifest
